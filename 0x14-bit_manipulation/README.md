Bit Manipulation Project
This project focuses on C tasks that are designed to help users learn about bit manipulation.

Tasks Completed:
Task 0.0 - 'binary_to_uint': This task includes a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

Task 1.1 - 'print_binary': In this task, you'll find a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

Task 2.10 - 'get_bit': The task contains a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

Task 3.11 - 'set_bit': Here, you'll find a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

Task 4.100 - 'clear_bit': This task involves a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

Task 5.101 - 'flip_bits': The final task includes a function that calculates the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
